# Limit Order Book(Trading)

In trading mainly there're two types of orders market order and limit order.

As their names suggests, market order is traded with the price based on exactly at the situation of the market. This has high risk because in the unpredictable market holder can lose or gain value of the stock but at the same time holder can trade any amount of stocks less than or equal to the supply in any instance of time during market hours.

Here comes a safer way of trading called limit order, which actually triggers itself at a fixed price and quantity. In the unpredictable market expected price can reach the limit order's preferences but it'll take time, longer than market orders or maybe expected price never match the limit order's preferences. This kind of orders have the problem of uncertainty but less risk.
